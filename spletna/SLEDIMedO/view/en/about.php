					<p><b>FOLLOWING MEDIA ANNOUNCMENTS</b></p>
					<p>
					As a part of EU the Republic of Slovenia is actively engaged in executing strategies for three macroregions - Danube, Adriatic-Ionian and the Alps region. All three regions have one thing in common - the information about the results of projects, financed by different EU instruments doesn't reach the citizens whom it concerns, even though they are usually project participles. Even the general national media and local media, be it websited or newspapers fail to report on these project efficiently.
					</p>
					<p>
					Nowadays, there's a flood of information, as there is with different media outlets, such as television, newspapers, media houses or social media. For that reason it's sometimes difficult or harder to find relevant information for specific searches. Although some projects may have their own websites or profiles on social media, through which they inform the interested parties, this is often not enough and the share of information stops here. This is a loss for everyone involved - the project executors, who worked on the project, and also for potential users of acquired information, who don't have access to information about potentials that these projects entail.
					</p>
					<p>
					The mail goal of this project was to study the possibilties of following news announcments or publication on the execution of EU projects. This includes the use of innovative technologies, which would allow a semi-automatic analysis of possibilities of following the information, with the help of a creative graphic user interface. As part of Innovative student projects for social benefits the project 'Following media publications' aims to improve the ability to follow the publications and also store relavant data about potential publishers of said news. Last but not least, one of the aims is also the creation of a website, which would allow the user to easily search for specific projects and news about them.
					</p>
					<p>
					The main focus of the research was local media, specifically news websites, as well as social media and project websites in themselves. With the help of different computer technologies we sourced relavnat data and news about European project in Slovenia. The result of the project is a wholesome ICT solution, which allows the user to follow media coverage of activies related to a specific project of a macroregion, that also includes partners from Slovenia. This tool allows a fast and efficient searching, viewing, filtering and processing of media publications of a given Slovenian news source.
